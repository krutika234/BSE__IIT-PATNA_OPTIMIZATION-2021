        "\n",
        "#### CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on the Python programming language. Its main purpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization applications straightforward by building on Python’s extensive standard library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Just llike CVXOPT, CVXPY is one such library,  which is fully dedicated for convex programming. Tutorial for the same is availabe <a href = \"https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/index.html\"> here </a>. \n",
        "\n",
        "##### Convex optimization is a field of mathematical optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. It has a wide range of application almost in all  disciplines such as automatic control systems, estimation and signal processing, communications and networks, electronic circuit design, data analysis and modeling, finance, statistics, etc. In finance and economics, convex optimization plays an important role.Some of the  examples are the calibration of option pricing models to market data or the optimization of an agent’s utility.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### With recent advancements in computing and optimization algorithms, convex programming is nearly as straightforward as linear programming. This tutorial covers a basic introduction one such library on how we can model our problem and solve it efficiently \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Cvxopt provides interfaces for almost all kinds of convex programming. It has a very nice interface for sparse matrix as of matlab, which can efficiently solve sparse matrix problem. To know more visit <a href =\"http://cvxopt.org/userguide/modeling.html\"> here</a>"
